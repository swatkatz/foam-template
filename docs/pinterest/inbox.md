# Inbox

## This is a place to write unstructured notes to be categorized later

## TODOs
- [ ] Write some notes on schema first, requirements and such
  - [ ] Read about gqlgen and see if we want to adopt something similar for new things
- [ ] Figure out more managed data details, perhaps by running the code or tests
- [ ] Try out the file watcher in Go
